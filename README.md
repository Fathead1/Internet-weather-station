Using openweathermap.org to get local weather information by interfacing a wemos d1 mini and an LCD screen (20x4)

This is made by using the built in functions of the Wemos D1 mini to connect wirelessly to the internet and recieve the weather for your local area. The data is then displayed on a 20x4 lcd screen which rotates through 3 menus.

You will need to get an API key from openweathermap.org, there is a free version which allows (I think) 1 request every 10min  which is plenty for weather updates.

You will also need city ID (in my example its Selsey, GB) you can download the list from here http://bulk.openweathermap.org/sample/
